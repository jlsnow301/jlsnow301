### Heya!

I'm Jeremiah Snow, or jlsnow301.

I'm a UI maintainer at TG Station, an open source game. I consider myself lucky to have found such a fun open source project to contribute to while spending time indoors during the pandemic. It's continued ever since.

- My expertise is in TypeScript/JavaScript
- I love to teach React and TypeScript skills
- I have authored some of the most downloaded tools for AI image generation
- I have a bachelor's in computer science / application development

I'm currently open to new projects and job opportunities, whether that's expanding my existing skillset or moving to languages I think are promising.
